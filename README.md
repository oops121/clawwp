# ClawWP — Ai Agent for WordPress

**Manage your WordPress site through chat.** Create posts, moderate comments, generate SEO, trade prediction markets, execute blockchain transactions — all from a simple conversation.

ClawWP puts an Ai agent in your WordPress admin sidebar. Instead of clicking through wp-admin menus, just tell your site what to do.

## Looking for an OpenClaw Alternative?

OpenClaw is a powerful open-source Ai assistant — but it requires self-hosting on a VPS or Docker, managing your own infrastructure, and connecting to WordPress through external plugins or APIs. For WordPress site owners who just want an Ai agent that works, that's a lot of overhead.

ClawWP is purpose-built for WordPress. Install, activate, add your API key, and start chatting — 60 seconds, no servers to manage.

| | ClawWP | OpenClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Installation** | WordPress plugin — upload and activate | Self-hosted (Docker/VPS) or managed hosting |
| **WordPress integration** | Native — uses WP roles, hooks, capabilities | Connects via REST API or MCP plugin |
| **Cost tracking** | Built-in with budget alerts at 80% and 100% | No built-in cost tracking |
| **MCP support** | Full client (HTTP + stdio) | Yes (native) |
| **Telegram, Slack, Discord** | Yes (Telegram free, Slack/Discord Pro) | Yes |
| **Prediction markets** | Built-in (GuessMarket) | No |
| **Blockchain wallets** | Built-in (AgentWallet, all EVM chains) | No |
| **Infrastructure needed** | None — runs inside WordPress | VPS, Docker, or managed hosting ($9-39/mo) |
| **Price** | Free / $9.99 Pro | Free (open source) + hosting + API costs |

If you're already running WordPress and want an Ai agent without spinning up extra infrastructure, ClawWP gets you there faster.

## How It Works

ClawWP uses Claude's native tool use (function calling) to execute WordPress actions. The agent has 7+ tools with JSON Schema parameter definitions and runs a multi-step execution loop:

1. You send a message
2. The agent analyzes your request and selects the right tools
3. Each tool call checks WordPress user capabilities
4. Results feed back into the conversation for follow-up actions
5. Up to 10 tool iterations per turn

```
You: "Write a blog post about our summer sale, add SEO, and schedule it for Monday"

ClawWP: [creates post with content]
        [generates meta description]
        [schedules for Monday 9:00 AM]

        Done! "Summer Sale 2026" is scheduled for Monday at 9:00 AM.
```

## Cost Tracking

The #1 complaint about Ai WordPress plugins is surprise bills. ClawWP solves this:

- Token usage and cost per conversation
- Daily and monthly spending breakdowns
- Cost breakdown by model
- Monthly budget with alerts at 80% and 100%
- Typical conversation costs $0.01–0.05

You always know what you're spending. No surprises.

## MCP Support

ClawWP is the first WordPress plugin with full **Model Context Protocol** client support:

Add your own MCP servers in ClawWP → Settings to give your agent any capability you need.
